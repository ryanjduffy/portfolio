            <h2>About</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    I have worked with web technology for nearly 25 years with
                    extensive knowledge and experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I have used and contributed to several front-end UI frameworks
                    and am confortable working within or beyond those tools. I am
                    quick to adapt to new environments and enjoy the challenge of
                    learning new languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have worked both in large enterprise systems spanning
                    mainframes through the web with complex service-based
                    architectures, serverless single-page web applications, and
                    applications designed for consumer electronics. I recognize that
                    there is no one tool that solves every problem and always look
                    to balance the needs of the business, the capabilities of the
                    team, and the suitability of the technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a kind and loyal leader that excels at strategic planning
                    and aligning people and work to achieve a vision. For the last
                    2.5 years, I've managed a team of 8 engineers building a UI
                    framework supporting LG's Smart TV platform. We built a team of
                    high performing and collaborative engineers that consistently
                    shipped quality software on schedule. I am very proud of the
                    product we built and culture we fostered to help each other and
                    our customers create great experiences for LG's products. I've
                    enjoyed the challenges of aligning people with the work,
                    mentoring and coaching individuals to reach their potential, and
                    collaborating with technical, product, and design leads to
                    deliver software.
