			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				I am a kind and loyal leader that excels at strategic planning and aligning people and work to achieve a
				vision.
				
				<span class="more">
					For the last 2.5 years, I've managed a team of 8 engineers building a UI framework supporting LG's
					Smart TV platform. We built a team of high performing and collaborative engineers that consistently
					shipped quality software on schedule. I am very proud of the product we built and culture we
					fostered to help each other and our customers create great experiences for LG's products. I've
					enjoyed the challenges of aligning people with the work, mentoring and coaching individuals to reach
					their potential, and collaborating with technical, product, and design leads to deliver software.
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				I have worked with web technology for nearly 25 years with extensive knowledge and experience in HTML,
				CSS, and JavaScript.
				<span class="more">
					I have used and contributed to several front-end UI frameworks and am comfortable working within or
					beyond those tools. I am quick to adapt to new environments and enjoy the challenge of learning new
					languages.
				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				I have worked both in large enterprise systems spanning mainframes through the web with complex
				service-based architectures, serverless single-page web applications, and applications designed for
				consumer electronics.
				
				<span class="more">
					I recognize that there is no one tool that solves every problem and always look to balance the needs
					of the business, the capabilities of the team, and the suitability of the technology.

					EnactJS
					<a href="https://github.com/enactjs" target="_blank">
						<img src="./GitHub-Mark-Light-64px.png" alt="GitHub Icon" role="presentation">
					</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="https://enactjs.com/">Enact</a> is a React-based UI framework built to support application
					development on webOS. I was the architecture lead for the project and a <a
					href="https://github.com/enactjs/enact/graphs/contributors">leading contributor</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm most proud of the team and culture we built and the flexibility we designed into the system but
					a few tangible examples of my technical contributions include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/enactjs/enact/blob/master/packages/core/kind/kind.js">core/kind</a>
						is a component factory implemented as a bridge from the Enyo framework which provides consistent
						structure for components including computed properties, event handlers with consistent
						references for reducing re-renders, and a styling utility that integrated seamlessly with CSS
						modules and ensured consistent application of developer-provided class names to the component.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a
						href="https://github.com/enactjs/enact/blob/master/packages/core/handler/handler.js">core/handler</a>
						is a functional programming-inspired event handler library that encourages readable and reusable
						handlers.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/enactjs/enact/pull/827">PR 827</a> introduced a significant
						refactoring of one of our most complex libraries to allow it to be testable.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/enactjs/enact/pull/1564">PR 1564</a> refactored our Slider component
						which had been the source of several bugs and which had been unable to meet the requirements for
						new features in its previous architecture. The result fixed several bugs and opened the door to
						new features as well as provided the flexibility necessary to use the same base component in
						multiple UI libraries (without copying the code around!).
					</li>
					<li>
						A teammate and I worked together to build a tool that generated TypeScript type definition files
						from our JSDoc headers which we incorporated into our build and release process to support
						TypeScript users and improve in-editor code completion for others.
					</li>

				</h3>
				<p>
					My most recent open source contribution was updating the
					<code>Math</code> section of ECMAScript&reg; Language Specification to use algorithmic steps instead
					of prose steps. I learned a lot from the early W3C specifications and as a result have wanted to get
					involved with specifications. At 141 comments, <a
					href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2122">this PR</a>
					had more comments than any other in my career.

					Firefox Debugger
					<a href="https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger.html" target="_blank">
						<img src="./GitHub-Mark-Light-64px.png" alt="GitHub Icon" role="presentation">
					</a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					I got involved with the Firefox Debugger when I learned it was built using React and wanted to
					expand my knowledge both in React and in the developer tooling space. I learned a lot about the
					dynamics of a open source project with a wide contributor base and about the technical details of
					debugger protocols, Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), and type checking in JavaScript. A few of my
					unique contributions include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/ryanjduffy/parse-script-tags">Created</a>
						and <a href="https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger/pull/2810">integrated</a>
						a module to parse the content of
						<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags within an HTML document.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://github.com/firefox-devtools/debugger/pull/7526">Updated the Flow dependency</a>
						and with that the broad type changes necessary to pass type checking. This was my first
						experience with type checking in JavaScript and taught me a lot about how it works at scale.
					</li>

					EnyoJS
					<a href="https://github.com/enyojs" target="_blank"><img src="./GitHub-Mark-Light-64px.png"
					alt="GitHub Icon" role="presentation"></a>
				</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="https://enyojs.com/">Enyo</a> was an custom component-based UI framework built to support
					application development on webOS. I first started on this project as an external developer and
					joined the team a couple years later. Learned a lot about working in open source and framework
					development during this time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was very active in both framework development and developer support on this project. I wrote a
					series of blog posts on this framework and grew to enjoy interacting with and supporting other
					developers using software. A couple notable contributions include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I wrote the "Enyo Daily" series of blog posts (starting with <a
						href="https://ryanjduffy.github.io/blog/2011/07/20/enyo-daily-1-preferences.html">Episode 1</a>)
					</li>
					<li>
						I created a performant view manager to handle view transitions for the never-released webOS
						Smart Watch.
